- Check every `Cycle to die` that a all processes called live at least once
- after `NBR_LIVE` LIVE calls decreas the value of `Cycle to die` by 50

- last one telling live (last one telling the live with appropriate player number) wins


List of things to show:
-[X] if pausing works then show play pause status
-[X] show speed limit
-[X] show all player number and name
-[X] Show cycle
-[X] show cycle to die
-[X] show number fo live called
-[ ] Show pocess que informations
	-[ ] number of processes in process que
-[ ] show process information
	-[ ] process id
	-[ ] process live call
	-[ ] show process registers (PC, CF, R1 - R6) befor and after changes in hexa decimal values
	-[ ] instruction that is being executed



- Ncurses Mac
	ncurses is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /Users/suddin/.brew,
	because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
	parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

	If you need to have ncurses first in your PATH run:
	echo 'export PATH="/Users/suddin/.brew/opt/ncurses/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

	For compilers to find ncurses you may need to set:
	export LDFLAGS="-L/Users/suddin/.brew/opt/ncurses/lib"
	export CPPFLAGS="-I/Users/suddin/.brew/opt/ncurses/include"

	For pkg-config to find ncurses you may need to set:
	export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/Users/suddin/.brew/opt/ncurses/lib/pkgconfig"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
for local computer :
For compilers to find ncurses you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/ncurses/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/ncurses/include"


Check the following instructions:
	[X][01] live
	[X][02] ld
	[X][03] st
	[ ][04] add
	[ ][05] sub
	[ ][06] and
	[ ][07] or
	[ ][08] xor
	[ ][09] zjmp
	[ ][10] ldi
	[ ][11] sti
	[ ][12] fork
	[ ][13] lld
	[ ][14] lldi
	[ ][15] lfork
	[ ][16] aff



: - asm error

01: dev null ca tourne en boucle
02: fichier bigbig.s
03: quand il y a pas de '\n' le message d'erreur n'estpas correcte.


last update in coreware:
	update: 05.09.2018
	- Changed the type of registers in t_vproc from uint32_t to int32_t.
		and with it all the function that modified registers such as fork  etc..
	- changed the togling system, there was two memory reads next to each other
		Which was bad, they have been separated proparly
	- Added the speed controle based on time thus not duing same stupid shit
		as `zaz` by waiting like an idiot for the sleep to stop.
	



last update in asm:
	update: 02.09.2018
	- Repeared the error when a comment char was attached with some type which
		was considered as some special object.
	- Changed some `printf` which showed errors to `ft_printf_error`.
	- Changed the error message in verify_int_indirect (added the word indirect).
	- reduced argument size in `lex_string` from 5 to 4 (for the FUCKING NORM!!
		Which ofcorse reduced some security...).
	- Added error message when the file could not be splited by newline because
		the file is not an ASCII file.
	- A usage was added when no file was given in the parameter (and only option)
	- A help menu was added.
	- A message on successful compilation which could be silenced bu the flag -q
